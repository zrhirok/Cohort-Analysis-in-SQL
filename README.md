Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed to perform a cohort analysis on a dataset of customer purchases. The analysis focuses on identifying customer cohorts based on their initial purchase month and tracking their subsequent purchase behavior over time.

Data Structure

The underlying data is assumed to be structured in a table with the following columns:

    customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
    purchase_date: Date of the purchase

nterpretation

The results of these queries can be visualized to understand:

    Cohort Size: The number of customers in each cohort.
    Cohort Retention: The percentage of customers retained over time.
    Purchase Patterns: The distribution of purchases across different months for each cohort.

Visualization

The results can be visualized using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Excel. Common visualizations include:

    Cohort Retention Curves: Line charts showing the retention rate over time for each cohort.
    Cohort Analysis Tables: Tables summarizing the number of customers and retention rates for each cohort and month.
    Heatmaps: Visual representation of purchase patterns across cohorts and months.

Further Analysis

This analysis can be extended to:

    Segmenting Customers: Analyzing cohorts based on demographics, purchase behavior, or other relevant factors.
    Predicting Churn: Using machine learning techniques to predict which customers are likely to churn.
    Personalizing Marketing: Tailoring marketing campaigns to specific cohorts based on their purchase behavior.
